# Pterodactyl-FiveM
This is an edit to https://github.com/Luxxy-GF/pterodactyl-fivem

## Feature Plans
I plan on supporting [Pelican](https://pelican.dev) and [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) simultaneously when Pelican's first stable release comes out. There will be two eggs to support this. :)

## About
This script installs FiveM on a Debian 12 server. It installs the latest version of FiveM and automatically keeps it updated. It also installs the latest version of FXServer.

## Installation
1. Download the egg from the [Releases](https://github.com/l-404-l/pterodactyl-fivem/releases/latest).
2. Upload the egg to your panel.
3. Create a new server and select the FiveM egg.
4. Start the server and wait for it to install.
5. Once the server is started, stop it.

## Updating
1. Go to the `Startup` tab.
2. Change the `Auto Update` to the desired value (default: `1` | `0` = disabled, `1` = enabled). Note: This will delete the `alpine` folder and reinstall it; no data will be lost.

## Notice
The `FIVEM_VERSION` variable:
- Defaults to `latest`, which is the latest optional artifact.
- Can be set to a specific version, e.g., `7549-801114291131277b01c25158b4261df6efbbc610`.
- If the `Auto Update` button is turned on when you press the `Reinstall Server` button, the `alpine` folder will be replaced with an updated version.

## Server Ports
Ports required to run the server in a table format. You only need the txAdmin port if you plan to enable txAdmin.

| Port    | Default |
|---------|---------|
| FiveM   | 30120   |
| txAdmin | 40120   |
